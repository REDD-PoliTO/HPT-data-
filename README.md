# HPT-data-for-fractured-geothermal-reservoirs
Synthetic data of six scenarios of Harmonic Pulse Test (HPT) responses in time for the characterization of fractured geothermal reservoirs are provided.  
Scenarios reproducing undisturbed conditions (S1-S4) and during operations (S5) are generated analytically by Saphire® (KAPPA Engineering) well test software, selecting the restricted inter-porosity model option.
Scenario S6, which accounts for the thermal zone around the tested well, was obtained by simulation performed with the numerical software tNavigator® (Rock Flow Dynamics), a high-performance numerical software for reservoir modeling and simulation.
These data are used to validate the model presented in Fokker, Salina Borello, Viberti and Verga (2025) Dual porosity model for Harmonic Pulse Testing in fractured geothermal reservoir.(Paper submitted).

# HPT-data-for-fractured-geothermal-reservoirs
Synthetic data of six scenarios of Harmonic Pulse Test (HPT) responses in time for the characterization of fractured geothermal reservoirs are provided.  
Scenarios reproducing undisturbed conditions (S1-S4) and during operations (S5) are generated analytically by the Pressure Transient Analysis software Saphire (KAPPA Engineering), selecting the restricted inter-porosity model option.
Scenario S6, which accounts for the thermal zone around the tested well, was obtained by   tNavigatorÂ® (Rock Flow Dynamics), a high-performance numerical software for reservoir modeling and simulations.
These data are used to validate the model presented in the paper Fokker, Salina Borello, Verga and Viberti  (2025) Dual porosity model for Harmonic Pulse Testing in fractured geothermal reservoir. (submitted to Energy Conversion and Management: X, paper number ECMX-D-25-00763).
